# Practical-JavaSript

This is a simple todo-list based on the Gordon Zhu's introductory JavaScript course (watchandcode.com). I am gradually adding more and more to this todo-list based on what I learn everday.
Hopefully I can create something a lot more visually appealing and can show off all the cool little things I learn.
